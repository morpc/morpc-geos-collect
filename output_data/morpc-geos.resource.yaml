  region derived from several sources. The geographies have been standardized for
  use by MORPC scripts, for example by reprojecting to a standard coordinate reference
  system and adding certain MORPC-specific fields. For more information, see the morpc-geos-collect
  workflow and the upstream workflows referenced therein. The included geographies
  are as follows: COUNTY, PLACE, COUSUB, TRACT, PLACE-COUNTY, COUNTY-TOWNSHIP-REMAINDER,
